# A-Btesting

A lightweight Streamlit tool for **A/B-testing prompt templates** side-by-side with Google Gemini. It lets anyone ‚Äì even non-technical testers ‚Äì iterate on prompts, chat with both variants in parallel, and quickly decide which prompt performs best.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** (inside your venv or globally):
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```
2. **Set your Gemini API key** (required):
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   # or add it to a .env file that your shell loads
   ```
3. **Run the app** from the repository root:
   ```bash
   streamlit run PromptImprov/replicate_solutions/streamlit_lab_fresh.py
   ```
4. Open the provided local URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

## üñºÔ∏è Interface Walk-through

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Sidebar ‚Üí User Info** | Provide contextual data (name, expected session length, summaries of previous sessions). This block is inserted into each prompt template via the special placeholder `<>Userinfo</>`. |
| **Tabs (Prompt-A / Prompt-B)** | Each tab holds a *prompt template* plus its own chat history. Edit the template, send a message, and see Gemini‚Äôs reply. |
| **Conversation** | Shows user and model messages. Model replies are displayed *without* XML tags for clarity. |
| **Show Action Items** | Pulls out whatever is wrapped in `<actionitems>‚Ä¶</actionitems>` tags from the latest model response. |
| **Latest replies / Action Items comparison** | Displays the most recent answer and extracted action items from both variants side-by-side for quick visual comparison. |

---

## üìù Writing Prompt Templates

1. **Include the `<>Userinfo</>` placeholder** where you want the contextual block inserted.
2. Instruct Gemini to wrap its outputs in the following XML tags:
   ```xml
   <response>
     ‚Ä¶the normal assistant reply‚Ä¶
   </response>

   <actionitems>
     ‚Ä¢ bullet-point action items here (if any)
   </actionitems>
   ```
3. Keep responses concise if desired (e.g. *"Answer in ‚â§50 words."*).
4. Example minimal template:
   ```text
   <>Userinfo</>

   You are a friendly coach. Answer in ‚â§50 words.
   Always wrap your main answer in <response></response> tags and list action items in <actionitems></actionitems> tags.
   ```

The app automatically:
- Swaps `<>Userinfo</>` for the user context block.
- Displays only the content inside `<response>` when showing chat history.
- Extracts and lists the `<actionitems>` block separately.

## üîÑ Workflow Tips

1. Draft two prompt variants (A & B).
2. Chat with each, judging helpfulness, tone, compliance, etc.
3. Click **Show Action Items** to verify structured extraction.
4. Decide a winner; tweak the loser; repeat.

Because the session state stores history per variant, you can iteratively refine prompts without losing the earlier context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Variable | Default | Description
---------|---------|------------
`MODEL_NAME` | `models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp` | Change to a different Gemini model if needed.
`temperature`, `top_p`, etc. | hard-coded in `streamlit_lab_fresh.py` | Fork the script to expose more tuning options.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause / Fix |
|---------|-------------------|
| **‚ÄúAPI key not found‚Äù** | Make sure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is exported in the shell that launches Streamlit. |
| **XML tags missing** | Double-check your prompt instructions. The app falls back to displaying raw text if `<response>` tags aren‚Äôt present. |
| **Rate-limit / quota errors** | Gemini free tier is limited; upgrade or slow testing cadence. |
